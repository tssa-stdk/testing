The standout feature of Git, compared to other version control systems, is its approach to data as a series of snapshots rather than a file-based system. This means Git captures a snapshot of your project at each commit, allowing for efficient tracking of changes over time. This snapshot mechanism is key to Git’s robust version control capabilities, enabling developers to easily revert to previous versions of their code. Git’s unique architecture, including its handling of the .git directory and the use of commit IDs, enhances its functionality. Consequently, Git ensures uninterrupted workflow, even in offline scenarios or central server downtimes, by allowing commits to a full project copy on the local machine. Once connectivity is restored, changes can be synchronized with the central server, exemplifying Git’s resilience and flexibility in software development environment
